It begins by sketching the energy challenges China faces \\nand its climate-change-related energy policies, in the context of the global geopolitics of the energy transformation. Next the \\nreport focuses on conventional energy sources (oil and natural gas), followed by electricity, and energy technologies. Although the \\nreport is intended primarily to survey developments to date, it concludes with some brief observations about the considerable \\nenergy challenges China faces in the years ahead.\\nWhile traditional concerns over energy security—ensuring a safe, adequate, and dependable supply of natural energy resources \\n(coal, oil or natural gas) and providing universal access to a stable and reliable electricity supply remain on the government \\nagenda, climate change brings new and urgent challenges to national energy policies when renewable energy is added to the \\nnational energy mix and new technologies are being developed to replace fossil-fuel consumption. Every aspect of energy \\ntransformation involves distinct technical issues that scientists and engineers have been working on. Energy transformation \\nnonetheless requires fundamental structural changes in the economy and society—changes which are much more difficult \\nto achieve.\\nThose challenges aren’t unique to China, but China faces more difficulties in pursuing the energy transformation because it’s the \\nworld’s largest coal producer and consumer and the largest carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter, it has the largest population, which \\nneeds modern energy, and it’s among the largest coal, oil, and natural gas importer as well. Technology innovation can drive, and \\nhas been driving, energy transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon sources of energy. It can present a massive opportunity for a \\nnational economy and thereby provide space and time for energy transition. Technology innovation, meanwhile, is a double-edged \\nsword that’s triggered more intensive competition and rivalry between China and some developed countries while it’s contributed \\nsignificantly to the expansion of low-carbon sources of energy. Diversification is the key behind its climate-change-induced \\nenergy policy—diversifying sources and kinds. This paper only briefly highlights some of the issues in this process of energy \\ntransformation in China.\\nChallenges\\nAt the UN General Assembly meeting in September 2020, China pledged to bring its carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and \\nachieve carbon neutrality by 2060 (2030/60 commitments, hereafter).1 This announcement surprised diplomats, climate activists \\nand China observers. It stunned policy experts, researchers and industries inside China for two reasons. One is that China seldom \\nannounces a target that it can’t fulfil. They do this, in terms of both domestic and international commitments, to avoid raising \\nexpectations that the government is unable to manage. Second, the energy transition in China is structural, requiring changes in all \\nsectors of the economy and in all places. With both its energy demand and carbon emissions still rising, China has about 30\\xa0years \\nto achieve its 2030/60 targets. In contrast, the EU had about 60–70\\xa0years to make the energy transformation, from its energy peak \\nin 1990 to carbon-zero in 2050, while the US and Japan have about 40\\xa0years for the transition, as their energy peaked around \\n2007–08. Timing is critical.\\nCurrently, major contributors to CO2 emissions in China are electricity, heat production and consumption (45%, growing at \\n4% annually), industries (33%, no longer growing), and transport (8%, lower than the 17% world average, but growing by 6% \\nannually).2 Coal combustion is by far the leading contributor to CO2 emissions in China in part because it’s the world’s largest \\nfactory, accounting for 28.7% of global manufacturing output, a little shy of the total of the next three major manufacturing' metadata={'source': '/workspaces/info-assist/docs/sample_doc/China, climate change and the energy transition.pdf', 'page': 1}</mark><mark style=\"background-color: #e6550d;\">page_content='factory, accounting for 28.7% of global manufacturing output, a little shy of the total of the next three major manufacturing \\ncountries, the US (16.8%), Japan (7.5%), and Germany (5.3%). It’s also the largest producer of several high-energy-intensive and \\nhigh-polluting products: steel (eight times that of the world’s second largest steel producer, India), fertiliser (more than double \\nthat of the world’s second producer (the US), cement and flat glass (half of the world’s total production). Most of these materials \\nwere consumed domestically, but a notable portion was also used overseas. In 2017, around 25% of the cement and 7.2% of the \\nsteel produced in China were exported, while, in 2018, China was the second largest fertiliser exporter (13.3% of the world total) \\nbehind Russia (15.1%). In addition to the scale of its energy-intensive industries, their production relies heavily on inefficient coal \\ncombustion. For instance, in China over 90% of crude steel is produced in blast furnaces that release about 1.5 to 5 times more CO2 \\nthan electric arc furnaces, while more than 45% of world steel production outside China is done with electric arc furnaces.3' metadata={'source': '/workspaces/info-assist/docs/sample_doc/China, climate change and the energy transition.pdf', 'page': 1}</mark><mark style=\"background-color: #fd8d3c;\">page_content='3\\n China, climate change and the energy transition\\nIn general, energy intensity (measured by energy consumption per unit of GDP) in China is about 1.7 times the world average, and \\nits emissions intensity (measured by CO2 emissions per unit of GDP) is double that in the US and two and a half times the average \\nfor the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).4 Many international, national and private organisations \\nhave provided road maps for China to meet its 2030/60 commitments.5 In China, government agencies, industries and think tanks \\nhave worked out their plans to move towards carbon neutrality. A common message from these organisations is that radical \\nactions are needed immediately to save humanity. Details vary in terms of priorities, sequences and strategies. For example, one \\ngroup has called on China to peak its emissions over the next decade and then rapidly decrease them to reach carbon neutrality by \\n2050, or 10\\xa0years earlier than the government’s commitment.6\\nA transition road map provided by the electricity industry shows the challenges. To meet its 2030/2060 commitment, the energy \\nstructure needs to be changed—that is, to replace coal combustion with electricity that must come from low-carbon sources, \\nwind, solar, nuclear and other technologies in the process of being developed. So far, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Iceland \\nhave already achieved or are close to zero-carbon electricity systems, while the US and UK have proposed to do so by 2035. In \\nChina, the plan is as follows:\\n• In the first phase (2021–2030), carbon emissions from the electricity system enter the peak plateau period around 2028 while \\nthe electrification process in industry, building and transportation continues. At the same time, electricity demand continues \\nto grow at an average annual rate of about 4.5%, with all new demands from low-carbon sources.\\n• In the second phase (2031–2050), carbon emissions in the electricity system will reduce by 90%. This means about 53% of \\nelectricity generation is from renewable sources, 13% from hydropower, 14% from nuclear, 7% from natural gas and 13% from \\ncoal generation capacity with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology.\\n• In the third phase (2051–60), the share of renewable sources will go up to 61%, hydro 13%, nuclear 16%, natural gas 3% and  \\ncoal with CCUS 7%.7\\nHow to meet its ambitious 2030/2060 commitment remains a hot topic for debate but it will demand changes in the entire \\neconomy. Perhaps, as in all countries, the most difficult challenge is that the energy transition needs to take place while \\nensuring a stable and reliable energy supply, which is the responsibility and priority for all governments for both political and \\neconomic reasons.\\nThe short-term setbacks of expanding coal-fired thermal power generation in China, Europe and elsewhere because of the war in \\nUkraine and its associated sanctions against Russian energy supplies won’t change China’s shift away from fossil fuels. The most \\nrecent World Energy Outlook shows that many countries are looking to accelerate structural changes because of the crisis and \\nindeed, for the first time ever, global demand for every fossil fuel exhibits a peak or plateau. As the global total demand for fossil \\nfuels declines from the mid-2020s onward, the foundation on which the modern economy and politics has been built is shifting. \\nThe transition might not take place as fast as climate change requires; it nonetheless is changing the global political, economic and \\nenergy landscape.8\\nNo successful energy transition can take place without innovation. Most low-carbon sources of energy, from wind, solar, biomass, \\nnuclear, hydrogen etc., are technology-intensive. Indeed, the entire transition to carbon-zero 2050 relies on technology innovation, \\nfor which the International Energy Agency (IEA) has identified 50\\xa0components in eight categories. In the past decade, the number' metadata={'source': '/workspaces/info-assist/docs/sample_doc/China, climate change and the energy transition.pdf', 'page': 2}</mark><mark style=\"background-color: #fdae6b;\">page_content='for which the International Energy Agency (IEA) has identified 50\\xa0components in eight categories. In the past decade, the number \\nof patents filed for renewable energy generation has tripled for solar, wind and bioenergy technologies. Between 2001 and 2017, \\nthe annual average growth rate for renewable patents was 16.23%, which was much higher than in other industrial sectors.9\\nSome technologies for low-carbon sources of energy are mature but not yet commercially competitive with fossil-fuel \\ntechnologies, such as offshore wind. Despite an over 40% decline, the cost of offshore wind remains more than double that of \\nonshore wind. Others, such as CCUS and green hydrogen, are in the development stages. The world needs an array of these \\ntechnologies to avoid human calamities; each country decides what’s in its own basket and its transition strategies. The race to \\nmaster new energy technologies has begun; the finish line may be 20–30\\xa0years away. Emerging technologies are transforming ‘the \\nglobal energy landscape’ and ‘will have particularly pronounced impact on geopolitics’.10 Power and influence will gradually shift \\naway from those countries that have traditional natural resources to those that can innovate and lead in technologies.' metadata={'source': '/workspaces/info-assist/docs/sample_doc/China, climate change and the energy transition.pdf', 'page': 2}</mark><mark style=\"background-color: #fdd0a2;\">page_content='Strategic Insights4\\nPlenty of analyses on China’s energy are available. Many examine conventional energy sources (coal, oil and natural gas), while \\nincreasingly they include climate change-related energy issues: a carbon-zero energy future, high penetration of solar and \\nwind in the electricity system, and innovation in energy technologies, from geothermal and hydrogen to nuclear fusion. Forces \\nrepresenting conventional and low-carbon sources of energy and those technologies in the process of development compete for \\npublic attention, the policy agenda, and public and private resources. Players differ in each category of issues, and so do the rules \\nof the games.\\nOver the conventional energy sources, debates have not changed fundamentally. They’re about access, trade, investment and \\nthe impact of their production and consumption on climate change.11 Renewable sources of energy are often about secondary \\nenergy—electricity and hydrogen—and how they compete with conventional energy sources and how the entire energy system \\nneeds to support renewable expansion.12 Low-carbon energy production and consumption depend more on technology \\ninnovation than natural resources.13 This is increasingly presented in the context of global competition for taking over the \\ncommanding heights in future energy—energy for 2030–2050 and beyond.\\nThe following sections provide a very brief discussion on three issues: conventional energy sources (oil and natural gas), \\nelectricity, and energy technologies. The focus is on the last two, as China has invested heavily in its electricity system and energy \\ntechnologies in which, in some areas, it hopes it will be able to set standards and lead markets. Energy transition is complex and \\nuncertain, involves a wide range of actors, and can be shaped by past policy choices and macroeconomic conditions. Despite \\nChina’s centralised political system, its energy transition takes place within a very fragmented institutional setting in which firms \\n(state-owned, private and multinational), interests, bureaucratic agencies, and central and provincial governments compete in \\npolicymaking as well as policy implementation. This critical component in energy transformation—domestic politics—which can \\nboth help and hinder the transition, however, is not discussed in this paper.14\\nConventional sources of energy\\nChina is poor in oil and natural gas reserves. Its proven reserves of oil amounted to 1.6% of the world’s total resources, while its \\nnatural gas amounted to about 2%. China became a net importer of oil in 1996, and the first major natural gas import took place in \\nthe early 2000s. Currently, China is the world’s largest importer of both oil and natural gas, and its dependence on imported oil has \\nrisen to over 70% of its domestic consumption. In 2019, a quarter of oil traded globally was bought by China. Saudi Arabia was the \\nlargest oil supplier to China from 2005 to 2015, and Russia then took over. They have been China’s top two sources of oil in recent \\nyears. Other major oil exporters to China include Angola, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela and Kuwait. After Chinese oil companies started \\ninvesting in oilfields, first in Sudan in the 1990s, then in some Central Asian and Latin American countries, there was an outcry over \\nChina’s national oil companies ‘taking over the world’, ‘removing oil from the world market’, undermining the energy security of \\nother oil-importing countries, and destabilising oil exporting countries.15 Securing reliable oil imports is a perennial issue for China \\nand covers a range of issues: the global oil trade and its price fluctuations, overseas acquisitions of oilfields, and transport safety.16\\nImporting natural gas is a relatively new phenomenon for China. In the past decade, natural gas consumption increased by double \\ndigits annually and imports more than tripled. The total natural gas consumption rose from 25\\xa0billion cubic metres (Bcm) in 2000' metadata={'source': '/workspaces/info-assist/docs/sample_doc/China, climate change and the energy transition.pdf', 'page': 3}</mark><mark style=\"background-color: #a8d08d;\">page_content='digits annually and imports more than tripled. The total natural gas consumption rose from 25\\xa0billion cubic metres (Bcm) in 2000 \\nto 186\\xa0Bcm in 2014 and 325\\xa0Bcm in 2020.17 Despite a compound annual growth rate of 7% in domestic production of natural gas \\nin the past decade, consumption grew even faster over the same period, at a compound rate of almost 11%. The population with \\naccess to gas jumped from 170\\xa0million in 2010 to 286\\xa0million in 2015 and climbed to 413\\xa0million in 2020. A major initial driving force \\nbehind this rapid increase in natural gas consumption was the commitment made by the central government in 2009 to reduce \\ncarbon intensity by 40%–45% below the 2005 level by 2020. Natural gas releases 40% less CO2 than other sources when it’s used as \\na source of energy. Thus, it’s been increasingly used to replace wood and coal for residential and commercial heating and cooking \\nto reduce pollution as well as CO2 emissions. A small proportion is also used for electricity generation and for industrial and \\nresidential consumption. The focus of Chinese oil and gas companies has changed from ‘oil and gas’ to ‘gas and oil’ for their energy \\nstrategy because of climate-change pressures.' metadata={'source': '/workspaces/info-assist/docs/sample_doc/China, climate change and the energy transition.pdf', 'page': 3}</mark><mark style=\"background-color: #c6dbef;\">page_content='5\\n China, climate change and the energy transition\\nThe challenge is that China is highly dependent on gas imports even though it increased local production from a little over 1% to \\n4.8% of the world’s total. In 2020, nearly 40% of its natural gas consumption came from imports, down from 45% in 2018. Half of \\nthe imports are through pipelines with its neighbouring countries, primarily Myanmar, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, \\nwhile the other half is in liquefied natural gas (LNG) form, mainly from Australia, Qatar, Malaysia and a few others. In 2002, Australia \\nsigned the largest ever export agreement with China with a total value of A$25\\xa0billion to supply 3.3\\xa0million tonnes of LNG a year \\nfor 25\\xa0years. With the completion of construction of the first terminal in Guangdong in 2006, Australian exports of LNG to China \\nbegan—the very first LNG imports for China. The volume later expanded to 42\\xa0Bcm of its total LNG imports of 114\\xa0Bcm in 2021, \\nmaking China the largest LNG customer for Australia.18\\nGrowing dependence on natural gas imports exposed China not only to global gas price fluctuations but also to changing \\ngeopolitics. For instance, China’s trade relationship with the US has always been full of tensions and more so during the Trump \\nadministration, which imposed tariffs on nearly all imports from China. Under the bilateral agreement negotiated in 2020, China \\nagreed to expand purchases of certain US goods and services by US$200\\xa0billion for the two-year period from 1\\xa0January 2020 \\nthrough 31\\xa0December 2021. As part of the agreement, China lowered tariffs on LNG imports from the US. The US’s LNG exports \\nto China jumped from zero in 2015 to 12.8\\xa0Bcm in 2021. For some, this was good news for the US natural gas industry; it was \\nan example of how ‘politics can lubricate a commercial relationship.’19 For others, this was a trap set by China in the bilateral \\nrelationship: ‘the United States exports commodities to China while China steadily edges the United States out as the dominant \\nplayer in global high-tech markets, including clean energy markets.’20\\nChina wants as much natural gas as it can buy to help the country’s energy transition, while it’s acutely aware of the vulnerability \\nof relying on natural gas imports from a single country. It plays the careful political game that all economic dependence calls \\nfor. That is, to reduce the dependency risks, Chinese oil companies negotiated with other natural-gas-exporting countries, both \\nthrough pipelines and in LNG forms. Just days before the war in Ukraine broke out in February 2022, China and Russia signed a 30-\\nyear contract on gas supply of 10\\xa0Bcm a year to China via a new pipeline that will go through Mongolia. The new gas sale would be \\nsettled in euros instead of US dollars, which have been dominating the global oil and gas trade since the first oil crisis in the 1970s. \\nAfter new sanctions were put in place because of the war in Ukraine, China and Russia renegotiated payment arrangements and \\nagreed in September 2022 that the sale would be paid 50% in Russian roubles and 50% in Chinese yuan—a deal for both: Russia \\nneeds new buyers for its oil and gas, while China embarked on its long march to promote its currency as a new anchor currency in \\nthe world after the global financial crisis.21\\nIn 2021, Qatar also signed two major deals with China: one was a 10-year deal to supply 2\\xa0million metric tonnes (mmt) a year and \\nthe other was to supply 1\\xa0mmt a year to Guangdong, starting in 2024 for 10\\xa0years. In November 2022, Qatar and China signed a \\nUS$60\\xa0billion plus deal to supply 4\\xa0mmt a year for 27\\xa0years, starting in 2026, from the North Field East that’s under development.22\\nConventional energy sources, oil and natural gas, in particular, are always intertwined with geopolitics.

China is rich in coal reserves even though they’re depleting fast. In 2019, China accounted for half of the \\nworld’s coal production (49.7%), while it was also the world’s largest coal importer. Nearly 60% of its coal is used to generate \\nelectricity, while the rest is used to produce steel, construction materials and petrochemicals. In 2010, the proportion of electricity \\ngenerated by coal-fired power plants reached over 81%. Until then, the main concern of the government was to provide its \\npopulation and economy with adequate energy supplies, especially electricity to those 70–100\\xa0million people in the country \\nwithout access to electricity and the 400\\xa0million in rural areas with only limited access, mainly for lighting.\\nThe rapid expansion of coal-fired power plants meant that related issues demanded urgent actions—the unsustainability of natural \\nresources, the vulnerability of energy resources imports, worsening environmental pollution and its related social problems, \\nand political embarrassment for the regime. Initially, government policies aimed to deal with some of those issues by closing \\nsmall-scale and high-polluting power generation plants and coalmines while adding more efficient supercritical power stations, \\nas part of the efforts to reduce energy intensity by 20% in the 2002–2020 period—a target set in 2003 as ‘quantitative indicators for \\nenergy efficiency’.25 As the expansion of coal-fired power plants continued, air, water, and soil pollution worsened and sparked a \\nmass outpouring of anger, frustration and protests. Pollution threatened political stability: ‘China’s 2013 “airpocalypse” triggered \\nthe first wave of government measures aimed squarely at reducing coal consumption in the most polluted regions.’26\\nThe Energy Development Plan for 2006–2010 included energy-intensity reductions for 11\\xa0industries, such as steel, aluminium, \\ncement and petrochemicals. In September 2012, the State Council unveiled its Action Plan. It set strict coal consumption reduction \\nplans and air pollution targets. The targets were formally incorporated into the Energy Development Plan in the 12th Five-year \\nPlan—to reduce energy intensity by 16% and CO2 intensity by 17% in the 2010–15 period.27 The 13th Five-year Plan’s Energy \\nDevelopment Plan set the first national mandatory limit on coal consumption: the percentage of coal in the total energy mix \\nwouldn’t exceed 58% by 2020, remaining higher than the world average.\\nThe so-called ‘dual control’ policy—to reduce energy intensity and reduce carbon intensity—has been in place for over a decade. \\nSince 2016, each province has also set its own targets for reducing energy intensity and CO2 intensity. The policy bore some ‘fruit \\ndue to a combination of improvements in energy efficiency in the industrial sector alongside the expansion of the service sector \\nin the Chinese economy’.28 But both coal and electricity consumption have kept rising, and so have CO2 emissions. This is the \\nchallenge of a paradoxical development in energy transition—decarbonisation and the expansion of electricity are both necessary \\nto tackle climate change. Energy decarbonisation re quires the ‘electrification of everything’ because direct burning of fossil fuels \\nreleases much more CO2 emissions and it’s much less energy efficient.

That is, the modern electricity system has been built on large \\ngeneration centres with centralised transmission and distribution networks, while renewable sources tend to be decentralised and \\nvariable.

In China, while thermal power plants \\nwere expanding at a breakneck speed in the first decade of the 21st century, the government started pushing for renewable \\ndevelopment. The Renewable Energy Law 2005 aimed to ‘promote the development and utilisation of renewable energy, improve \\nthe energy structure, diversify energy supplies, safeguard energy security, protect environment, and utilise the sustainable \\ndevelopment of the economy’.31 Other policies included, for instance, the Medium and Long-Term Energy Development Plan \\n(2004–2020), the Medium- to Long-Term Nuclear Energy Development Plan, released in 2005, the Renewable Energy Law of 2005, \\nthe 11th Five-year Plan Energy Development Plan issued in 2007, the Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable \\nEnergy in 2007, and the guideline of renewable energy development plan for the 11th FYP (2006–2010).32 Five-year Plan to \\nincrease the share of renewables in total energy consumption to 10% by 2010 and 15% by 2020. The main objective for renewable \\ndevelopment at the time was to help 11.5\\xa0million people without access to modern energy.\\nSince 2008, China has invested heavily in a basket of low-carbon energy technologies to meet continuing rising demands and to \\ncontrol worsening air, water and soil pollution that became political problems for the regime: coal and gas generation plants, \\nwind and solar renewables, and nuclear. One significant change was clearly stated in the National Energy Technology Program \\nduring the 12th Five-year Plan period (2011–15), released by the National Energy Administration (NEA). This was China’s very first \\nenergy science and technology development plan. One strategy outlined in the plan was to develop renewables in combination \\nwith upgrading China’s economy to move up global value chains. The very first sentence of the plan clearly stipulates its \\nstrategic thinking:\\nEnergies are the foundation of the national economy; they’re also technology-intensive industries. ‘Safety, high efficiency, and \\nlow carbon’ are the core features of modern energy technologies. They’re the battlefields of global competition in controlling \\nthe commanding heights in future energy.\\nIt stated clearly that ‘China will launch a series of strategic and advanced research projects on frontier technologies in basic \\nsciences, like geology, materials, environmental studies, electricity and electricity systems, and information and automation \\ncontrol.’ Support for energy technology innovation would also include support in ‘energy equipment technologies’ and in large \\ndemonstration projects. The plan identified four areas for technology innovation: exploration and exploitation (primarily for oil \\nand natural gas); processing and conversion; power generation, transmission and distribution; and renewables. It emphasised that \\nresources would be invested in building an energy innovation system  that integrates all stages of innovation,33 from research and \\ndevelopment (R&D) on ‘frontier’ technologies and basic science, such as geology, materials, information and automation, energy \\nequipment technology and manufacturing, to supporting major demonstration projects in the field of nuclear power, the use of \\ncoalseam gas, exploration for and development of shale gas, energy storage, smart grids, and so on.\\nAlong with these policies—the Renewable Energy Law 2005, the Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy \\n(2007)), and the 11th and 12th five-year plans on Energy Development—the government not only set the target of renewable \\ndevelopment, but also offered incentives, such as tax benefits for renewable development, and grid companies were mandated \\nto connect all approved new renewable supplies.

Over 70% of large-scale wind and solar projects \\nwere in northern regions where there was plenty of coal but electricity consumption was low, such as Inner Mongolia, Gansu \\nand Shanxi. The excess of electricity supply from both renewable and thermal generation in resource-rich regions couldn’t be \\nexported to where end users were along the coast due to inter-regional transmission bottlenecks. The wind curtailment ratio in \\nGansu reached 43%, while wind and solar curtailments in Xinjiang reached 38% and 32%, respectively, in 2016.

The global average \\ncost of newly commissioned utility -scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects declined by 88% between 2010 and 2021, while that of \\nonshore wind fell by 68% and offshore wind by 60% (Table 3).38' metadata={'source': '/workspaces/info-assist/docs/sample_doc/China, climate change and the energy transition.pdf', 'page': 7}</mark><mark style=\"background-color: #e6550d;\">page_content='9\\n China, climate change and the energy transition\\nTable 3:  Installed total solar photovoltaic capacity, 2012 to 2021 (GW)\\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\\nWorld 107 137 176 223 295 390 483 585 710 843\\nChina 6.7 18 28 43.5 28 131 175 205 253 306\\nEU (27) 69 78 82 86 90 94 102 118 137 158\\nUS 8 12 16 22 33 41 50 29 74 94\\nSource: IRENA, Renewable capacity statistics 2022 , Abu Dhabi, 2022.\\nAnother impact of the rapid expansion of renewables is that global solar PV manufacturing capacity has moved from Europe, \\nJapan and the US to China over the past decade. China invested heavily (over US$50\\xa0billion in new PV supply capacity—10\\xa0times \\nmore than Europe) and has created more than 300,000 manufacturing jobs across the solar PV value chain since 2011. One \\noutcome of the investment was the expansion of production and market share. China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of \\nsolar panels (such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules) exceeds 80%. That’s more than double China’s share of global \\nPV demand. In addition, the country is home to the world’s 10\\xa0top suppliers of solar PV manufacturing equipment. In 2021, the \\nvalue of China’s solar PV exports was over US$30\\xa0billion, or almost 7% of China’s trade surplus over the past five years. In addition, \\nChinese investment in Malaysia and Vietnam made those countries major exporters of PV products, accounting for around 10% \\nand 5%, respectively, of their trade surpluses since 2017. This has been one of the thorny issues between China and the US over \\ntheir trade relations.39\\nAs China expanded its solar PV manufacturing, it also improved its innovation capacity, measured by patents. It has ‘changed the \\nway the world thinks about energy innovation, with a focus on component performance improvement brought about by Chinese \\ninstitutions and companies.’40 China isn’t alone in adopting the strategy of energy transition and industrial policy. The Obama \\nadministration sought seriously and systematically to promote renewable energy technologies by adopting ‘a series of policy \\nstrategies and instruments previously foreign to the federal government’ to pursue two combined objectives: the use of renewable \\nenergy technologies and the promotion of American leads in the global ‘cleantech’ industry.41 A decade later, many in the US argue \\nthat the US is losing its leadership in renewables and nuclear because of the shifting landscape of global R&D spending. That is, \\nthe share of the US in the global total R&D spending declined from 70% in 1960 to 30% in 2019 (even though it remains the world’s \\nlargest R&D spender), while China’s share of global R&D rose from 4.9% in 2000 to 23% in 2019 (Table\\xa04).42 A similar pattern of \\nchange occurred in energy R&D expenditures.\\nTable 4:  Spending on energy R&D by governments, 2015 to 2021 (US$ billion 2021)\\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\\nNorth America 7.76 7.73 7.85 9.05 9.59 10.42 10.25\\nJapan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand 3.66 3.35 3.25 3.82 3.70 3.80 3.93\\nEurope 8.68 8.46 9.14 9.08 9.95 10.52 11.25\\nChina 7.50 7.42 8.70 9.80 8.96 9.93 11.64\\nRest of world 1.49 1.31 1.45 1.60 1.53 1.47 1.31\\nTotal 29.09 28.27 30.39 33.35 33.73 36.14 38.38\\nSource: IEA, online .\\nChina’s increase in R&D spending did help develop some renewable technologies.

Competition is about who’ll get there first, for instance, with commercially competitive \\ncarbon capture and storage technology, small modular nuclear reactor technology, green hydrogen, and system support \\ntechnologies that rely on automation, big data and artificial intelligence. Innovation can offer opportunities for new sectors to \\ndevelop and expand. It also needs government support. Energy transformation requires a whole basket of technologies. Not \\nevery country chooses all or the same options because of their different natural energy endowments, the existing energy mix and \\nstructures, and the priorities of the country.

New coal-fired power stations were concentrated in a few provinces: Hunan (5.3\\xa0GW), Shaanxi (2.6\\xa0GW), \\nGansu (4 GW) and Anhui (2 GW). \\nBehind this change are the complex politics and difficulties in climate-change-related energy transition.

To avoid similar energy disruptions as a result of extreme weather, natural disasters and conflicts in Europe, \\nChina chose a policy of building excess basic supply capacities while expanding all other low-carbon sources of energy. This may \\nlead to a lot of waste, as the average utilisation of coal-fired power plants in China is now below 40% (in contrast to 60%–70% in \\nOECD countries), and the average lifespan of a thermal power station is around 40\\xa0years, but the country might have to pay for the \\npotential waste to ensure stable and reliable energy supply. Government needs to balance its priorities. There’s no one perfect \\nsolution, while decisions need to be made.\\nConclusion\\nThere can be no one easy analysis of energy in China not only because each energy sector has its own distinct structure, features, \\nrules and institutions, but also because there are many contradictory developments in China. China is the world’s largest coal \\nproducer and user, the world’s largest CO2 emitter and the world’s largest oil and natural gas importing country, and it built half of \\nthe world’s new coal-fired power plants in 2021. Meanwhile, China has built the world’s largest solar and wind capacities and has \\nthereby been instrumental in bringing down solar PV module prices by 90% since 2009 and wind turbine prices by 49%–78% since \\n2010. Based on these apparently contradictory developments, some insist that China is leading on a ‘highway to climate hell’ by \\nnot only being the world’s largest CO2 emitter but also by investing in overseas fossil-fuel capacities. Others see China and Chinese \\nfirms as leading the energy transition, which ‘is an industrial transition’.51\\nMore importantly, these and other contradictions also reflect China’s complex domestic politics. Energy transformation is a \\nmultidecade process. It will ‘entail fundamental structural changes of the economy: China’s energy, industrial and transport \\nsystems, its cities, and land use patterns will have to undergo dramatic transformation,’ as a World Bank study argues.52 Prices \\nwill rise; jobs will be lost; some firms, even sectors, may become obsolete; and pain might be concentrated. While inaction isn’t \\nan option, to forge ahead on the energy transformation requires government to make difficult choices. No problem is unique in \\nChina, while the challenges and complexities entailed in the energy transition need to be multiplied many times when compared \\nto those in other countries that are so much smaller, at more developed stages, or both, and where the problems of geography and \\neconomy make the process so much easier.' metadata={'source': '/workspaces/info-assist/docs/sample_doc/China, climate change and the energy transition.pdf', 'page': 10}</mark><mark style=\"background-color: #a8d08d;\">page_content='to those in other countries that are so much smaller, at more developed stages, or both, and where the problems of geography and \\neconomy make the process so much easier.\\nThe renewable industries in China started and expanded initially because of worsening air, water and soil pollution—all of \\nwhich are causes of climate change. Their development has been closely aligned and integrated with other national economic \\nand industrial priorities, including jobs, sustaining economic growth, the abatement of conventional pollution, upgrading \\nChinese industry’s position in global value chains, and energy security. To support this development, public investment in clean \\nenergy research and development in China grew fastest among major countries and this led to ‘China’s rise as a major player \\nacross clean-energy markets … with an uptake of the goal of competitiveness and economic growth in new and repurposed \\ninstitutions’.53 China now needs to manage the consequences of climate change itself by changing the country’s entire energy and \\neconomic system.

Storage supporting renewable penetration, however, comes from a range of sources, such as water pump storage, compressed air \\nstorage, and ‘virtual power plants’ that depend on system controls, big data and AI technologies. These new technologies are all options to help \\nmanage the stability and reliability of large grids with deep penetration of renewables (IEA, Unlocking the potential of distributed energy resources ,' metadata={'source': '/workspaces/info-assist/docs/sample_doc/China, climate change and the energy transition.pdf', 'page': 11}</mark><mark style=\"background-color: #e6550d;\">page_content='manage the stability and reliability of large grids with deep penetration of renewables (IEA, Unlocking the potential of distributed energy resources , \\nOECD, Paris, 2022; L\\xa0Baringo, M\\xa0Rahimiyan, Virtual power plants and electricity markets , Springer, 2020).

Both sides took the issue to the World Trade \\nOrganization several times. The question was debated among economists who focus on manufacturing industries, trade specialists, \\nenvironmentalists and people in strategic studies. Even different government agencies, from the departments of State, Energy, Treasury and \\nCommerce to US trade representatives, have presented different views, and the same is case with different government agencies in China. There’s no \\nstraightforward right and wrong way of handling the issue, as many have pointed out: ‘If Biden decides to end tariffs, trade in solar products will be \\nfreer, which will boost his plans for shifting quickly to solar energy to reduce American dependency on fossil fuels and thus combat climate change. \\nOn the other hand, if he decides not to keep them, he could be accused of betraying American manufacturing workers and labour unions.’ This is \\nan interesting topic for international political economy, but it’s also beyond the scope of this paper.

While \\nsome prices were freed in the past couple of years, no policy on how to recover capacity cost was yet developed.
